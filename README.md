# scaled-size-list
A Javascript component for creating a vertical list of figures, scaled in size based on their relative values.

This Javascript component can accept a list of entities as JSON, then read 3 key attributes to create a vertical list in which numbers are scaled.

The inspiration for this control, and some of the code, comes from this New York Times article:
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/19/us/budget-proposal.html?_r=0

Next steps for this repository are to:
* Make the component more configurable, and remove hard-codes, to improve reuse
* Wrap as a Node.js module
